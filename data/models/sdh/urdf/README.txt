I rotated the palm link 90 degrees such that the Y axis points to the thumb and the X axis goes along the fingers. 
This is necessary to follow my planning convention of X: Fingers. Also had to modify the urdf of the hand and the
file aoi/utils/robotData.cpp.

The hand has an offset of 60 degrees with respect to the axis of the final arm motor.
