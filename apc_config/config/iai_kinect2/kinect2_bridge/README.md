## Description

This is a bridge between [libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) and ROS.

### Highlights

- delivers up to 30 frames per second on non high end hardware
- delivers up to 30 frames per second over gigabit ethernet
- support for compressed image transport
- utilizes multiple cores and uses special OpenCL based implementation of the depth registration and libfreenect2

## Dependencies

- ROS Hydro/Indigo
- OpenCV
- libfreenect2 (either directly form [this fork](https://github.com/wiedemeyer/libfreenect2) or with the changes of [this pull-request](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2/pull/48) and [this pull-request](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2/pull/47).)

*for the ROS packages look at the package.xml*

## First steps

For the depth registration the camera intrinsics and extrinsics need to be known. The program reads in the values from the `data/<serialnumber>` folder. For each new sensor you need to add a subfolder with the serial number of the device as the folder name. In this folder you need to provide 3 yaml files with the intrinsics and extrinsics. These files can be created by the `kinect2_calibration` tool (or you can copy the files provided in one of the other folders, but results can be sub optimal). The device serial number is shown when `kinect2_bridge` or `Protonect` from libfreenect2 is started, it also appears in `dmesg` when you connect the sensor. [More information on calibration](https://github.com/code-iai/iai_kinect2/tree/master/kinect2_calibration#calibrating-the-kinect-one).

When `kinect2_bridge` is running you can use the `registration_viewer` to display the images or point cloud: `rosrun registration_viewer viewer -kinect2 -image` or `rosrun registration_viewer viewer -kinect2 -cloud`.

## Notes

- Images from the same frame have the same timestamp. Using the `message_filters::sync_policies::ExactTime` policy is recommended.

## Usage

```
kinect2_bridge [options]
  -fps <num>     limit the frames per second to <num> (float)
  -calib <path>  path to the calibration files
  -raw           output raw depth image as 512x424 instead of 960x540
```
